				<p>I came into the world on this or that day, was brought up in this or that place, went properly to school, am something or other, am called so and so, and don't think much. I'm a neat, nice, quiet member of the society of man, a so-called good citizen, like to drink my glass of beer like a sensible person, and don't think much. It goes without saying that I'm fond of good eating, just as it goes without saying that ideas aren't for me. Clever thinking is unquestionably not the business of this quiet member of the society of man, who is fortunately not alone in this, for there are legions of such people who, like me, are fond of good eating and little thought.</p>
